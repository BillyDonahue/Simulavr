What you can do:

Go with mouse into the tx widget and type commands.
Allowed commands are: "l", "u" and "q". After "l","u"
command you can enter a word. The entered word
will be send to the uart or to the lcd display.

Example:

l TextOnLcd

will print "TextOnLcd" on the lcd.

u example

send the word "example" to the uart.


All characters which the uart receives will also be transfered back.
So you see your own typings.
